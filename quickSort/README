several questions need to be noticed:
//*****************************************************************************************************************************
Be careful of the index of the array. Make sure that your index will not outof array's bound.
if you choose one standard to initialize the index, unite the index to your standard.
for example:
	if you set array index from 1 to n ,then you must pay attention to the index is not the real index, it means the "index+1".
To avoid unnessary problem ,you'd better use the real index: index from 0 to n-1;

//*****************************************************************************************************************************
In the main demo ,if you want to initialize with the element of random number, you can call the c++11 lib of std::default_random_engine;
If you want to set the bound of the random ,you can use the std::uniform_int_distribution;

And more interesting thing is that the random number is not recreated every time. In other words,the ramdom number will be the same if you
only recompile it or rerun it without change the source code. The lib_function is so interesting and you must be careful in the next time.

Finally, remember add the compile parameter of "-std=c++11" because the random lib_function is only suported since the version c++11.

Never forget free() after the malloc(); Modified by the second commit.
